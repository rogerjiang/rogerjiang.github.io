## problem

Last time, I found something is diff


## just like this


How do I reset the microphone access permission so that the app will ask for microphone access permission again as if it were downloaded fresh from the App Store?

Reinstalling the app does not accomplish what I need. When I set the permissions in Settings->Privacy->Microphone, I can only turn permissions on or off. I need to reset it so that it asks for permissions again.

At least starting from iOs 7.1.1 there are switches to change access permission for every single app.

Look in: Settings->Privacy, select the kind of subsytem of your interest ( eg: microphone ), you will see your app in the list. Change the value of the selector according to your needs.

Have a nice day, Stefano

You can RESET your privacy settings in iOS Settings.

Settings > General > Reset > Reset Location and Privacy.

NOTE: Privacy settings for all apps will be reset.

Permissions for an uninstalled app are reset after a day.

So, if it is not urgent, you can wait for it reset. I know this is not an ideal solution but it is app specific

If you change your bundle identifier, that'll also reset the permissions for your app.
